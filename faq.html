        <h1>FAQ'S</h1>
        <h2>What is Sustainable environment?</h2>
        <p>The concept of sustainable development can be interpreted in many different ways, but at its core is an approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of the environmental, social and economic limitations we face as a society.All too often, development is driven by one particular need, without fully considering the wider or future impacts. We are already seeing the damage this kind of approach can cause, from large-scale financial crises caused by irresponsible banking, to changes in global climate resulting from our dependence on fossil fuel-based energy sources. The longer we pursue unsustainable development, the more frequent and severe its consequences are likely to become, which is why we need to take action now.  </p>
        <h2>Can all items be recycled?</h2>
        <p>Your local recycling facility might not accept all recyclable items. This is especially true with plastics. While plastic bottles are the most commonly recycled plastic products, other plastics may or may not be accepted in your area, so first check what your local recycling provider accepts. It is important to understand that the existence of a plastic resin code on the product does not guarantee that the product is recyclable in your area. Additionally, glass may not be accepted in some areas, so please confirm with your local provider.</p>
        <h2>What is meant by Green Building?</h2>
        <p>Sustainable buildings minimise energy and water consumption and are a key part of sustainable urban development that seeks to combat climate change. From large skyscrapers to novel museums, below we review some of the green buildings that pave the way to more responsible urban planning.According to data from the United Nations (UN), in 2050 around 68% of humanity will live in cities. These represent only 3% of the planet's surface, but consume 78% of energy and produce 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, in 2016 the UN itself improved the New Urban Agenda to advise countries on their urbanisation processes and make cities more habitable, inclusive, healthy, resilient and sustainable.        </p>

        <h3>Reverse Logistics</h3>
        <p>Reverse logistics has also been defined as the return/exchange, repair, refurbishment, remarketing and disposition of products. Reverse logistics has become an important way for companies to improve visibility and lower costs across the supply chain. The reverse logistics process starts with the point of consumption and ends at the point of origin, with the purpose of recapturing value or ensuring proper disposal.</p>
